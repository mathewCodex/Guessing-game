    <!-- new task -->
    <!-- Create a number guessing game to generate a number between the range of 1 and 2. 
    The game should prompt users for their username.
    Set range as function parameter and prompt the player to predict the generated number between 
    the given range. At a correct guess,
     the game should award the player a point and move them to stage 2 by increasing the range limit
      value by 1, e.g. range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 and so on. 
      Connect replit account to GitHub and save your program on GitHub.
